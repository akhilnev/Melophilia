Introduction:<br />
Our task for the given project is to design a catalog of products tailored towards a specific theme, we thought of one and we will get in detail about it shortly.

Project Description:<br />
Our idea was to make a website that holds within it a melophile’s dream store. It is a website that displays the official merchandise of all famous music artists. The reason we chose to do this was the fact that, it is hard to reach every artist’s merchandise and compare them. We wanted to make a website that possibly displays every artist’s merchandise and lets them compare designs and prices and lets them chose what they want. 

Idea of Catalog of Products<br />
Our idea is to initially list the merchandise of the artist ‘Drake’ and list the other artists’ merchandise we would have in the near future. After clicking on the merch the user wants to get, we would redirect them to the official website of the artist and show them the buy now page of the chosen merchandise. The idea is to, hopefully, make money out of affiliate marketing.
